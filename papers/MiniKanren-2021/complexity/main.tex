\section{Unification and Reification Complexity}

Syntactic unification of terms is a core operation in logic programming. The performance of the  conventional unification algorithm is hard to analyse in general case due to its non-trivial recursion scheme. The time can be exponential of initial terms size in the worst case. However, for the most practical cases met in logic programming the time of any unification during program execution is linear or even constant of the size of the input. So the inner workings of unification are often neglected when estimating performance of programs.

\mK has a distinctive way of implementing unification fit in accordance with its ideology. Firstly, since \mK aims at purely functional implementation of an embedded logical language it uses a triangular form of substitutions~\cite{UnificationTheory} which allows simple extension in a non-mutable fashion. Such substitution are lazy in a sense that they keep a particularly substituted value for each variable, so to obtain a fully substituted value it may be necessary to apply a substitution a number of times. In particular, we need the full cycle of applying substitution in the end of search to get the result for a querried variable, this process is called \emph{reification}. \mK uses the conventional Robinson's algorithm for unification~\cite{UnificationTheory}, adjusted for triangular substitutions~\cite{TRS}. Secondly, since \mK commits to adhere to logical consistency, by default it always performs occurs checks during the unification. Occurs check is a test of existance of cicles in the added binding and it is necessary for the correctness of the result of unification. But it is very costly in terms of performance and rarely violated, so some logical languages (such as Prolog) omit it, while \mK does not.

In this section we show how in \mK the time of unification can be taken into account easily and compared to the scheduling time in many practical cases. Specifically, we identify two tests on relational programs, which can be checked dynamically, under which every unification in the program performs a constant number of basic operations, excluding occurs checks. At the same time the occurs checks, which can be estimated separately, add a significant overhead to the time of execution and often increase time complexity of the program. A number of programs satisfying the given tests and showing the impact of occurs check are listed in the \sectionword~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

The actual time of unification depends on a concrete choice of a data structure to represent triangular substitutions (which are maps from integers to terms). So we will estimate complexity parameterized by basic operations performed on substitutions during the program execution: we denote by $\lookuptime{\sigma}$ and $\addtime{\sigma}$ the worst time complexity of lookup and add operations (depending on a substitution $\sigma$ in some point of execution). The obvious candidate data structure is standard library maps for a given language (and many implementations like fasterKanren and OCanren use them) and they have logarithmic complexity for both operations, so we expect this multipliers to be negligible. However, some implementation like microKanren may use associative list for simplicity of presentation (which have linear-time lookup and constant-time addition) or more comple data structures like random-access lists (which have log-time lookup and average constant-time addition) so we keep this parametriezation for the general case. The review of performance of different date structures for triangular substitutions is given by~\citet{SubstDataStructs}.

The basic building block of the unification with triangular substitution is a walk operation. This operation checks whether a given variable is mapped by a given substitution to a term with a constructor on the top level. To do it we need to look up the binding in the substitution and the map and then continue to do so while we get a variable as a binding (since triangular substitution may contain only partially substituted bindings), then we get either a term with a constructor on the top level or a variable unbound by substitution in the end. This operation may diverge if there is a cycle on variables, but this never happens in miniKanren, the substitutions are always consistent in this sense~\cite{NominalUnificationWithTriangularSubstitutions}. Nevertheless walk can require up to linear time (depending on the size of substitution) of lookups. However the variable-to-variable bindings occur rarely in practise and usually walk finds the required binding in one step. We can take the absence of variable-to-variable bindings as our first practical test: for \emph{flat} substitutions (substitutions without such bindings) walk always takes only one lookup. But we make it less restrictive and allow a constant number of variable-to-variable bindings for cases when the input of the program contain some logical variables that a bound by other intermidiate logical variables during the program execution.

\begin{definition}
The substitution is called \emph{constantly flat} if the number variable-to-variable bindings in it does not depend on the parameter in the input.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}
If during the evalution of a relation in \mK all current substitutions are constantly flat, then the time of any walk during that evaluation on substitution $\sigma$ is $\O(\lookuptime{\sigma})$.
\end{lemma}

The unification of two terms goes by the standard recursive descent. Each time it meets a variable walk is performed, and if it ends up on a variable unbound by substitution the occurs check is performed and the substitution is extended if it is passed. The substitution grows during the process, so the unified terms grow too and the descent can go beyond the size of initial terms. But we argue that this happens not that often. For example, for a linear case (when any variable occurs in terms at most once) the extensions of the substitution during the unification do not affect the unification in other branches, so the descent will stop at the minimal depth of two terms. 

\begin{lemma}
For a unification of two terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ with a current substitution $\sigma$, which is constantly flat, if any variable occurs at most once in at most one of the terms $\{ t_1 \sigma, t_2 \sigma \}$, then the time this unification takes, excluding occurs checks, is $\O(\min(|t_1 \sigma|, |t_2 \sigma|) \cdot (\lookuptime{\sigma} + \addtime{\sigma}))$.
\end{lemma}

In particular, if the size of one of those two terms does not depend on the input (which is usually the case) the unification performs a constant number of basic operation. This is our second practical criterion: linearity and constant size of one the terms in every unification.

In the presence of the occurs checks checks, however, we need to also go through the every term we add in the substitution. This changes $\min$ in the estimation above to $\max$, which makes the huge difference. Roughly speaking, in average the number of basic operations for every unification with occurs checks is approximately an average size of all terms unified in program (which is usually linear of the input). Therefore occurs checks add a huge time overhead for program execution in \mK, both for asymptotics (see \sectionword~\ref{sec:evaluation}) and for actual time~\cite{WillThesis}. This fact calls for an investigation into ways of going around occurs checks in \mK. Although simply omitting them is not an option for \mK, there are other known approaches (mostly explored for Prolog), for example static tests insuring that occurs checks for a given program will never be violated~\cite{OccursCheckStaticTest}. As far as we know, for now there are no such solutions adopted for \mK.

For now, as we estimate the time of every individual unification it might be not clear how it relates to the metrics for the scheduling time. But since we consider cases in which unification is relatively fast (constant number of basic operations), the number of unifications during an execution plays more important role and it can be simply limited by the number of semantics steps $d(s_{init}(n))$ (because every unification is a separate step in the semantics). Similarly, although the time of basic operations depends on size of substitution in different points of execution, logical variables for these bindings come either from the input (where there are usually a constant number of them) or from a fresh variable allocations during the evalutation (each of which is a a separate step in the semantics). So the number of allocated logic variables (and therefore the maximum possible number of bindings) is limited by $FV(input(n)) + d(s_{init}(n))$. So, for example, for a usual case, when our practical tests are satisfied and the input contains a constant number of logic variables, for a standard implementation and without occurs checks the total time of unifications $T_u$ will be $\O(d(s_{init}(n)) \log d(s_{init}(n)))$.

The time of reification $T_r$ can be estimated in the same way, since reification simply goes through the resulting term similarly to occur check. So in the case when the resulting substitution is constantly flat, the number of basic operations for the reification will be limited by the size of the output (multiplied by a constant). This time is usually subdued by the time of unification and scheduling, but not always (see examples in \sectionword~\ref{sec:evaluation}).
